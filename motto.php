	<span class="headline">&quot;Integrity Through Excellence&quot;</span><br>
	<br>
	<span class="BODY">Our mission statement is a simple motto. It embodies the essence of the existence of 
the Martial Science University Family. Simply put, we exist to perpetuate the good 
name and works of our progenitor, Mr. Ed Parker Sr. as well as all the many facets of 
the martial sciences, not just <strong>American Kenpo</strong>.<br>
<br>
With the Martial Science University, <strong>SubLevel Four Kenpo</strong> we have chosen to 
explore Mr. Parker's creation through to its many advanced concepts. It is not our 
desire to &quot;traditionalize&quot; his work, but by Ed Parker's own wish, take it to new levels 
of proficiency. By doing this, we raise his works to the level of the true science he 
envisioned and performed, while maintaining humane, reasonable, and ethical martial 
applications as we were taught.<br>
<br>
Others have made a choice to stay within the context of Mr. Parker's published 
commercial works. Something Ed Parker himself didn't do. We have chosen to move 
in the direction Mr. Parker himself was pursuing. We are very fortunate Mr. Parker 
taught, and pointed the way for our Executive Director, who has taken on this 
extremely monumental task to move the science further into the future for all Martial 
Science University Students regardless of style or discipline.<br>
<br>
Although by no means an easy road, we feel our motto, when used as a guide, will 
keep us moving in a moral and ethical direction. Simply stated, we derive our 
excellence by maintaining our integrity in the teaching process, as well as in the 
pursuit of the science. Our standards are uncompromising. Our integrity is fueled by 
our demand for excellence. Therefore, one feeds off the other and, insure the existence 
of the whole. This is important if we are not to become a shell or shadow of Mr. 
Parker's dream of a true martial science.<br>
<br>
In doing this, we will bring only the best of the science to all who would abide by the 
strict principles and guidelines necessary for excellence and study, and will always 
strive to maintain it. We will do what Mr. Parker could not do in his desire to spread a 
form of his art around the world. We will reject those who do not have the work ethic, 
desire, mantle or physical capacity to study and execute a true physical science. Some 
may be accepted, but many will be rejected. In the real world, not everyone can be 
elite or even good. We have a line we have drawn for furtherance of the science. All 
others, I'm afraid, will have to be spectators of what we do if they can't meet these 
standards.<br>
