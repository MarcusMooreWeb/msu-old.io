<b>SubLevel Four Kenpo<sup><small>TM</small></sup><br />
   Instructor &amp; Intern Certifications</b><br />

<ul type="square">
<li>Because certain divisions of the Martial Science of SubLevel Four Kenpo and 
	the codification of all its inclusive elements are a work in progress, 
	continuing education is mandated for a current certification.</li>
<li>Teaching certifications are granted based on the currency of the student in 
	the latest material within the calendar year, and only at the level of 
	competency. There does not exist any permanent status other than &quot;uncertified, 
	expired, or emeritus.&quot; No one has permanent teaching authority.</li>
<li>Some have chosen to participate in a broad spectrum of SL-4 Kenpo elements, 
	while not teaching the strict curriculum that supports SL-4 Kenpo belt promotions 
	from the central school.</li>
<li>Some senior students have ceased being current, but still train in their most 
	current information regularly with no desire to teach.</li>
<li>No one person has promotion authority in SL-4 Kenpo, and all SL-4 diplomas of 
	all ranks, are only issued by the board of examiners from the main school in 
	Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. signed by the most senior staff members. All 
	numerical ranks are considered &quot;honorary.&quot;</li>
<li>Names shall be added, deleted and status changed as necessary. Send an email 
	addressed to the attention of the &quot;MSU Dean of Instruction,&quot; 
	<a href="mailto:martialscienceuniversity.com?subject=MSU Dean of Instruction" class="BODY">martialscienceuniversity.com</a>
	for the current certification status of any listed or unlisted participants.</li>
