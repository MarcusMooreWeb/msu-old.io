    <a href="/web/20111006004226/http://www.martialscienceuniversity.com/"><strong>Chi</strong></a> is a term that is used across the full range of the Chinese Culture and 
    is included in all of its diverse sciences. The reason for this is these sciences 
    are all interconnected to, and relate to the human body. This includes of 
    course what I, and my teacher, choose to call Martial Science. Additionally 
    you have medicine, philosophy, art, calligraphy, etc. The term has a range 
    of meanings from the mundane to the esoteric depending on the context and 
    the user's intention. </p>
  <p>In Martial Science it is the end result of anatomically correct neuromuscular 
    coordination, major and minor sub-skeletal alignment, in conjunction with 
    mental focus and proper breathing and timing. Or briefly, it is a kind of 
    energy created by the extremes of biomechanical efficiency. </p>
  <p>&quot;Chi&quot; has also been described as an esoteric type of &#8220;life 
    force&#8221; in <strong>Chinese Medicine</strong> and in the Chinese Cultural Philosophy. Common 
    descriptions use terms like electricity, or energy flow like it is a fluid. 
    As a fluid you'll hear phrases like &#8220;let it flow.&#8221; Expressed in 
    electrical terms, it can be &#8220;discharged, strong or weak, positive or 
    negative.&#8221; Often the fluidic and electrical analogies are used in consort 
    with each other. Expressing it this way embodies it with the characteristics 
    of bio-energy that has the qualities of a fluid and some unseen force simultaneously. 
  </p>
  <p>Discussions of chi centered on the life force analogy began with Chinese 
    Philosophy. Under Taoist teachings, chi is the moving or animating force of 
    the universe and is everywhere. The earth, heavens, and man are all a part 
    of &#8220;the force.&#8221; For a man, life and chi are synonymous. No chi 
    no life. When the chi has been drained, disturbed or unbalanced there is illness 
    or a weakness. When it has been completely drained, death ensues. These functions 
    of chi are all governed by natural laws. </p>
  <p>Even the modern Western Medicine interpretations gives this perspective merit. 
    It has been shown through a controversial process called Kirlian photography, 
    that all living things have an &#8220;aura&#8221; and a &#8220;life force&#8221; 
    that can be seen and recorded on film. This energy or life force is so strong 
    that the aura it manifests continues to display parts of the anatomy long 
    after they have been removed through injury or accident. An amputation of 
    a limb continues to maintain its &#8220;aura&#8221; emanating from the main 
    life force, as if this energy supports and perpetuates the whole of the being. 
    The process has also proven once an individual has passed away, the life force 
    and its aura cease to exist. It has been further proven that individuals with 
    well developed &#8220;chi&#8221; are capable of visualizing another's &#8220;chi&#8221; 
    through their own &#8220;aura' with the naked eye.</p>
  <p>Chinese Philosophers classify force of this type as &#8220;vitalism.&#8221; 
    The Chinese Doctrine of Vitalism suggests the functions of living organism 
    are due to a vital principle, separate and apart from physicochemical forces. 
    In other words, there are processes that are not fully explained by the laws 
    of physics and/or chemistry. </p>
  <p>Defining &quot;chi&quot; as a kind of biomechanical efficiency is not unique 
    to physical activities like martial arts. When applied properly it becomes 
    <a href="/web/20111006004226/http://www.martialscienceuniversity.com/" class="body"><strong>Martial Science</strong></a>. 
	In any physical discipline &#8220;chi&#8221; is viewed as 
    a &quot;quality.&quot; In competitive physical activities phrases like &#8220;He's 
    on fire,&#8221; He's really feeling it,&#8221; or &#8220;He's in the zone,&#8221; 
    are common explanations for what cannot be easily explained otherwise. </p>
  <p>When used this way, &quot;chi&quot; refers to the end product of proper alignment 
    of the human body and all its parts necessary to perform the function at maximum 
    mind body focus. This results in efficient movement and the optimal and maximal 
    use of what can be sometimes described as an effortless force. In striking 
    situations when executed properly the effects although devastating, seem effortless 
    to the person performing the action. </p>
  <p>Sometimes so much so, they report not even feeling the contact despite the 
    results. Proper chi is therefore the optimal skeletal alignment and most coordinated 
    use of the muscular and neuromuscular system for the purpose of generating 
    the maximum amount of force with the minimal amount of effort, in conjunction 
    with the mind and breath. Put more simply, the utilization of maximum force 
    and effect with a minimum amount of effort. Without it, there is no &#8220;chi.&#8221; 
    Without &#8220;chi&#8221; there is no efficient biomechanical movement. One 
    cannot exist without the other. They feed off of each other, and the catalyst 
    to begin the process is built around the proper teaching of body mechanics. 
    In western martial &#8220;arts&#8221; this is lost, (or perhaps never found) 
    knowledge.</p>
  <p>This philosophically contradicts the Ed Parker commercial Motion-Kenpo Karate 
    Concept of &#8220;Economy of Motion.&#8221; Just because a motion is economical 
    does not necessarily translate into efficiency on a grand scale. Motion-Kenpo 
    Karate Concepts do not address the internal because by design they favor &#8220;motion 
    efficiency over anatomical proficiency.&#8221; This favoring of motion has 
    its advantage in that it allows a student to learn to use simple motion to 
    overwhelm an opponent rather quickly. Motion-Kenpo Karate's only true stated 
    goal is quick individual self-defense skills, and with proper instruction, 
    it can do that very well.</p>
  <p>Motion-Kenpo Karate at its greatest depth explores motion in conjunction 
    with its &#8220;Mathematical and Alphabetical Re-arrangement Concepts.&#8221; 
    Because the possibilities and combinations are endless it can be &#8220;explored&#8221; 
    forever, but this is &#8220;motion constipation&#8221; and will never yield 
    advanced knowledge beyond its motion base. Ed Parker was aware of this pairing 
    of terms that created a commercially successful oxymoron, but because it was 
    not representative of the whole of his methods, it was of little concern at 
    the time. Besides, it served and continues to serve its purpose quite well.</p>
  <p>If one were to examine a true biomechanical model, proper body alignment 
    focuses on some fundamental elements. The use of the complete body as an efficient, 
    integrated unit is absolutely paramount in execution. There is no singular 
    part of the human anatomy that once moved, does not affect another part of, 
    or the entire body in some way. Then, in conjunction with the correct coordination 
    of the relaxation and the contraction of appropriate muscle groups, we finally, 
    add the proper alignment of the sub-skeletal structure to transfer and/or 
    receive external stimuli or force.</p>
  <p> Although this rather simplistic analysis of &#8220;chi&#8221; appears to 
    be expressed in western scientific principles, an examination of 18th and 
    19th century Tai Chi shows that they discuss and place fundamental emphasis 
    on many of these same essential biomechanical factors. Thus the explanation, 
    although expressed in western terms is definitely Chinese, not western. </p>
  <p>Although &#8220;chi&#8221; or the internal is not represented in &#8220;Kenpo 
    Karate,&#8221; it is represented in the more complete Ed Parker's American 
    Kenpo, or what I choose to call Sub-Level Four Kenpo. Ed Parker spoke of &#8220;&#8230;sub-categories 
    of distance four&#8221; in Kenpo Karate. Sub-Level Four Kenpo falls outside 
    the definition of the four distances or ranges of motion. Here the relationship 
    between antagonists is more intimate and specific in applications. This is 
    where all the elements necessary to produce &#8220;chi&#8221; are greatly 
    expressed but not exclusively. This is where the &#8220;whole&#8221; of Ed 
    Parker's genius resides and it exists exclusive of the terms &#8220;karate&#8221; 
    and dominant &#8220;motion&#8221; concepts. I personally use the descriptive 
    term &#8220;Advanced Concepts&#8221; because it applies to all physical movement, 
    along with its Sub-Level Four Kenpo Martial Science component. </p>
  <p>Kenpo Karate teachers have realized their art is incomplete but many have 
    not shared this with their students. Like parents they answer questions with 
    &#8220;because&#8221; while omitting the &#8220;I said so.&#8221; Martial 
    art teachers often use the word &quot;chi&quot; similarly, as a catchall term 
    for any aspect of the martial arts that they themselves don't understand, 
    understand only in a vague sense, or find difficult to articulate. </p>
  <p>Kenpo Karate violates some very important rules of learning. There is an 
    assumption that learning any art happens in gradual stages and that each stage 
    is laid on a foundation of what the student has already learned. Kenpo Karate 
    routinely gives students information out of order and context through &#8220;what 
    if&#8221; scenarios creating confusion. Taught properly, there is a very strict 
    order to learning. Oftentimes, however, the student will ask questions about 
    some aspect of the art that cannot usefully be answered because the student 
    simply does not know enough to place the answer in context. Kenpo Karate by 
    design must focus on self-defense skills immediately. Long term benefit normally 
    found in traditional martial art training is eschewed in favor of immediate, 
    albeit limited, success.</p>
  <p>In the western arts, &quot;chi&quot; is used to describe phenomena that do 
    not lend themselves to verbal articulation. Many aspects of physical arts 
    are not easy to talk about; they are subjective feelings. Thus in sports you 
    hear phrases such as &quot;in the groove,&quot; etc.&quot; In the creative 
    arts you will hear such things as &quot;the words flowed out of me,&quot; 
    &quot;the band clicked,&quot; or &quot;I found my rhythm.&quot; These types 
    of expressions reflect very real experiences that are common to people involved 
    in that activity. But the experiences are not easy to articulate in concrete 
    terms. Therefore a metaphor such as &#8220;chi&#8221; may be used. To someone 
    outside the art the metaphor makes little sense, but to someone who has had 
    the same experience the metaphor is clear. </p>
  <p>However, on the less legitimate side even in &#8220;kenpo,&#8221; sometimes 
    the term &quot;chi&quot; is used as nothing more than a way to hide the teacher's 
    ignorance. It seems an unfortunate reality that in all times and places martial 
    arts fraud has been prevalent. Not just recently in contemporary America, 
    but in the Japan of Miyamoto Musashi's time, and pre- World War II Hawaii. 
    Unfortunately a high percentage of martial arts instructors do not know or 
    understand their own art in any depth. Thus the use of terms such as &quot;chi&quot; 
    provides a convenient cover for their ignorance. </p>
  <p>The fact that such a central concept as chi has multiple uses is a result 
    of a number of factors, not the least of which is the reality that fraud, 
    charlatanism, incompetence and ignorance are prevalent in the martial arts. 
    We can take some cold comfort in realizing that the use of &quot;chi&quot; 
    to cover fraud and ignorance is not a recent phenomenon but rather a traditional 
    part of the martial arts of any nation or any time period.</p>
  <p> The two fundamentally different views of chi owe their existence to factors 
    in Chinese Culture. However, beyond that, there are also factors in Chinese 
    culture that have lead to the multiple and sometimes confused understandings 
    of &#8220;chi&#8221; in the martial arts as it spread outside of China. </p>
  <p>Firstly most of the theory surrounding the Chinese Martial Sciences including 
    the concept of &#8220;chi&#8221; dates back to pre-modern scientific methods. 
    The martial arts were not subjected to modern scientific methods of scrutiny 
    until late in the 20th century. Prior to that Chinese martial art practitioners 
    were long on practical experience, but lacked the type of quantifiable information 
    that is the basis of modern scientific study. </p>
  <p>Because of the many wars and conflicts, the availability of human bodies 
    for experimentation and examination for the effects of applications were quite 
    plentiful. It wasn't difficult to discover what worked, but the quantification 
    of the &#8220;why&#8221; scientifically was not yet available. <br>
    Because of this, it was difficult to distinguish the separate entities inherent 
    in high- level martial science skill and performance. Therefore the Chinese 
    themselves used terms like &quot;chi&quot; vaguely to describe a mix of principles 
    that could not be separated through experimentation. </p>
  <p>Even in western boxing as well as other modern athletic endeavors, the various 
    scientific approaches to human performance have only recently began to be 
    measured and validated scientifically. </p>
  <p>Also China has always had a tradition-bound culture for most of its history. 
    This has manifested itself in a very specific relationship between students 
    and teachers. All arts are regulated strictly. Two basic rules are that teachers 
    do not &quot;explain&quot; to students and students do not question teachers. 
    This tradition extends itself to all student-teacher relationships. If the 
    martial arts teacher says something, the student will never inquire beyond 
    that and the teacher will not explain beyond his own statement. As a result 
    vague and confused ideas are passed on, and that includes &quot;chi.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>A third factor is that Chinese language and literary forms, do not lend themselves 
    to specific discussions of martial science. The classical Chinese is purposely 
    vague and overly flowery. &#8220;The rising eagle grasping with the invisible 
    talon.&#8221; Although great for poets and philosophers, it is poor when it 
    comes to concrete discussions of things such as martial science. </p>
  <p>To make sense of martial arts material written in classical Chinese the reader 
    must have a background in martial arts. Even so, written material in Chinese 
    does not lend itself to do much to clarify what &#8220;chi&#8221; is. Taken 
    together, these three factors are in large part responsible for the different 
    frameworks and nuances of meaning that &quot;chi&quot; has in the modern martial 
    arts.</p>
  <p> Chi as life force is the most widespread and traditional explanation. Chi 
    as biomechanics is the most provable explanation from a scientific perspective. 
    And, regrettably, ignorance is the most common use of the term. </p>
