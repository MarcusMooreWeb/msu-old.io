		<strong>DR. RON CHAP&Eacute;  L</strong><br>
<em>Sublevel Four Kenpo - International Director</em><br>
<br>
'Ron' Chapél is the world's foremost authority on Advanced American Kenpo Concepts and it's SubLevel Four Kenpo Curriculum. Since the passing of Ed Parker Sr., "Doc" Chapél has become a sought after, internationally well-known lecturer. He continues to develop "Advanced American Kenpo Concepts" to continue the legacy of his teacher, mentor, and friend, Ed Parker Sr. 

 <br><br>
The SubLevel Four Kenpo Curriculum explores the side of Kenpo that few have ever seen. Taught from an anatomical based perspective it includes Anatomical Structure Theory, Control Manipulation Theory, Cavity Presses, Destructive Sequencing, the cultivation of internal energy, etc. relying on an in-depth understanding and knowledge of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation relative to the dynamics of human combat interaction, and is the pinnacle of Combat martial Science. 
<br><br>
 
Additionally Ron Chapél has developed an intensive "Arrest and Control" component specifically for public law enforcement professionals. Called the "Universal Arrest & Control System," this was a project started with Ed Parker Sr. and the finished video series and curriculum was and is dedicated to him. These are just a few of the elements of American Kenpo that were explored with him by Ed Parker Sr. throughout their almost thirty year friendship. 
<br><br>
 
In addition to continuing Ed Parker's teachings and developing  <http://www.martialscienceuniversity.com/> SubLevel Four Kenpo, Dr. Chapél is head of the Martial Science University, and Senior Master Professor of the SL4 College. MSU reflects his commitment to furthering Ed Parker's dream of American Kenpo with the emphasis on the educational aspect, endeavoring to make the "martial arts school" function as a college university. By instituting rigorous admission standards, placing a priority on knowledge through course work, required minimum levels of effectiveness, with standardized hours and a firm curriculum. All designed with the dream of one day becoming academically accredited, as Ed Parker wanted. MSU encompasses all styles and presently also has a College of Jiujitsu, as well as Silat, and Within Arms Reach, (W.A.R.). 

 <br><br>
Functioning as an educational institution as opposed to a "commercial karate school," MSU, requires teacher certifications over and above belt rankings of its instructors. No one has teaching authority without specific accreditation. Only the Institute Board of Credentials grants rank and degrees, as any other academic institution. All Black Belt numerical ranks are issued on an Emeritus basis. The Martial Science University also requires completion of very specific course work, and awards Martial Science Degrees accordingly. The "University" is the "Kenpo School" of the millennium. Our standards are extremely high, totally uncompromising, and demand a significant commitment from students. 
<br>
 <br>
Ron Chapél lived in close proximity to Ed Parker Sr. in Southern California since childhood, and has been in the martial arts since he was a young boy. He began his training along side White Lotus Grandmaster Douglas Wong with his uncle, Art Wong, Grandmaster of the Five Animal System and Splashing Hands styles of Qung-fu, where Ed Parker Sr. also had studied. In 1963, Ron Chapél finally met Ed Parker at a local tournament expo, and shortly afterwards became a friend and subsequent student. Their friendship and student/teacher relationship lasted without any interruption until Ed Parker's death in 1990. 

 <br><br>
Several years before Ed Parker's death, Dr. Chapél was awarded his 7th Degree Black Belt Diploma after completing an assigned thesis project examining the rank structure of Ed Parker's International Kenpo Karate Association, and is featured in every volume of the Ed Parker Infinite Insight Series, the Ed Parker Sophisticated Basics Videos,  and is prominently listed as a First Generation Student on Ed Parker's Family Tree of Black Belts.  
<br><br>
 
Since the passing of Ed Parker, Dr. Chapél has been awarded his 8th, 9th, and 10th degree rankings by ATAMA, The prestigious American Teachers Association of the Martial Arts. Founded by Martial Art great Shaolin Kenpo Grandmaster Ralph Castro, Raymond "Duke" Moore, along with Wa Do Ki Kai Grandmaster John Pereira, Doc Chapél served as it's first Vice-President of the newly formed Southern California Chapter for Five years, conducting seminars to members of all styles. He is also profiled in the ATAMA "Who's Who of the Martial Arts publication. He has an acknowledged 9th degree from Dan-Zan Ryu Jiu-Jitsu, a 9th degree from the World Federation of Karate-Do, chaired by the late Edwin Hamile, and a 9th degree from the Universal Martial Arts Society. He has a Guru ranking in W.A.R., and has studied Goju-Ryu, Shorin Ryu, Hap-Ki-Do and more. After the death of Ed Parker Sr., he was formally given the position, and title of "Senior Master Professor" from the Martial Science University as well by the Credentials Committee. He purposely refuses to use the title 'Grandmaster' or wear belt stripes that he feels is reserved for his friend and mentor Ed Parker Sr. 
<br><br>
 
Dr. Chapél has been recognized and awarded proclamations by the Los Angeles City Council as a Martial Arts Pioneer and as the founder of a Martial Arts Institution in Southern California. He holds service awards from the city, state, and County of Los Angeles as well for his unselfish youth work in the community. He also has proclamations from the Assembly and the legislature of the State of California for his work in this area. Further, the Martial Science University and its parent Ed Parker Institute are the only American Kenpo schools in the world certified by the World Federation of Karate-Do. 

 <br><br>
In addition to Dr. Chapél's extensive martial arts training, he has over thirty years of public law enforcement experience. He has worked as a uniformed street cop, as a California State Police Officer Protective Services Agent protecting the Governor of California, along with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and most recently as a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal in Judicial and witness security. He has taught in Southern California Police Academies and has taught college courses for credit as a resident instructor/teacher. 
<br><br>
 
With a strong desire to maintain a base system as a point of reference, Dr. Chapél has continuously shown his teachings and interpretations to be insightful, highly effective and very practical. He proves that American Kenpo is a dynamic, highly functional art, even with the passing of its Creator and one and only Grandmaster, Ed Parker Sr, and freely gives all the credit to Ed Parker for his knowledge.<br>

		<strong>ED PARKER</strong><br>
<em>Board of Credentials Co-Chair</em><br>
<br>
Edmund Kealoha Parker, Jr. (professionally known as Ed Parker, Jr.) was born on 
November 15, 1959, in Glendale, California. Ed is the son of the late Ed Parker, 
Sr., Senior Grandmaster and founder of 
<a href="/web/20120720091554/http://www.martialscienceuniversity.com/" class="body"><strong>American Kenpo Karate</strong></a>. Some consider Ed's 
father to be one of the greatest martial artists who ever lived. 
Ed, Sr. was named by Black Belt Magazine as &quot;the Father of American Karate.&quot; He was 
noted for launching the careers of many martial arts motion picture stars such as 
Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris; and he was the personal karate instructor, bodyguard 
and friend to the late King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley. Elvis was so involved 
with Kenpo and with his instructor, Ed Parker, Sr., that he put his martial arts 
logo on the side of his guitar. This crest is present on the Elvis Presley guitar 
pin, now displayed in all Hard Rock Cafes. Ed, Jr. was reared in Southern California. 
His early years were focused on the study of art and theater and, at that time, he 
received the Bank of America Art Award. At the age of 19 he moved to Arizona, doing 
social work as a voluntary missionary on numerous American Indian reservations. Ed 
worked for two years with the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Southern Ute, Havasupai, White 
Mountain and Jicarilla Apache tribes. He then moved to the Island of Oahu, Hawaii, 
where he focused on Illustration and the Theatrical Arts at Brigham Young University 
Hawaii Campus. During this schooling he studied and made student films, one of which 
won him an award for the Best Student Film for 1982 in the State of Hawaii Film Festival. 
He was awarded an internship on the television show &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; He also received 
12 University art and theatrical scholarship awards. After finishing his education, 
Ed returned to California where he continued to study at the Art Center College of 
Design. Upon completion of his training, he went into partnership with his father. 
From 1983 to 1991. Ed produced nine International Karate Championships, annual karate 
tournaments that host over 6,000 competitors each. &quot;The Internationals&quot; was the largest 
and longest- running martial arts tournaments in the world having run for over 40 
years. He has co-published and designed over 20 martial arts books. In December of 
1990, Ed's father passed away. Since then, Ed has continued his involvement with 
the martial arts industry and has produced six educational martial arts videos. 
In June of 1992, he published &quot;The Encyclopedia of Kenpo,&quot; a complete reference 
resource on American Kenpo karate, based on the teachings of his father, Ed Parker, 
Sr. In March of 1993, Ed produced the first annual Martial Arts Expo. This event 
attracted over 8,000 participants. The Expo featured the first- ever martial arts 
talent star search. Celebrity support for this event came from actors Wesley Snipes 
(&quot;Passenger 57&quot;), Steven Ho (&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.2&quot; & &quot;-3&quot;), Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; 
Wilson (&quot;Ring of Fire&quot;), Jeff Speakman (&quot;The Perfect Weapon&quot;), and World Kickboxing 
Champion, Benny &quot;The Jet&quot; Urquidez Support was also derived from producers Aaron Norris 
(&quot;Side Kicks&quot;) and Rick Nathanson (&quot;Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story&quot;). During this same 
year, Ed earned his First Degree Black Belt.<br>
<br>
Ed has appeared in several movies and television shows such as, &quot;Seven&quot;; &quot;Magnum P.I&quot;; 
&quot;Jake and the Fat Man&quot;; &quot;Inside Edition&quot;; &quot;Hello L. A&quot;; &quot;The Curse of the Dragon&quot; with 
Chuck Norris, James Colburn and Kareem Abdul Jabbar; &quot;E! Entertainment television, The 
Biography Channel, and his appearance in a major motion picture, Universal Pictures' 
feature film &quot;Dragon: The Life of Bruce Lee,&quot; wherein he portrayed his own father. 
The University Times honored Ed with a cameo award for his performance in &quot;Dragon.&quot; 
He hosted &quot;The Night of the Golden Masters,&quot; a martial arts special for Showtime 
which features many martial arts masters from all over the world including film 
star, Ernie Reyes, Jr. He completed the choreography for the movie &quot;Deadly Takeover&quot; 
(starring martial arts film star, Jeff Speakman and veteran actor, Ron Silver), as well 
as the film &quot;Cage II,&quot; starring Lou Ferrigno, in which he served as the Associate Art 
Director.<br>
<br>
During the past 20 years Ed has taught, lectured, produced, published, written, 
illustrated, designed, choreographed and acted in various martial arts-related areas. 
He has a Black Belt in American Kenpo karate under the instruction of Ron Chap&eacute;l and 
has trained for 40 years with such noted instructors as SGM Ed Parker Sr., Richard Planas, 
Lee Wedlake, Tommy Chavies, Martin Wheeler, Vladimier Vslilas, Frank Trejo and many others. 
He also cross trains in other arts such as the Russian art Systema, Jiu Jitsu and some Phillipino 
arts. Ed worked for over 20 years as a freelance illustrator and graphic artist, Ed worked on 
numerous design campaigns, and has produced over 5,000 pieces of artwork, two of which were 
for National Public Radio; and with Leonard Nimoy on a two-part series of dramatic audio 
tapes entitled &quot;Jewish Stories from the Old World to the New&quot; and &quot;Jewish Short Stories 
from Eastern Europe and Beyond.&quot;<br>
<br>
For 4 years Ed focused his talents to the drawing of a tribute to the legacy of Ed Parker, 
Sr.: a series of portraits of prominent individuals within martial arts and the Kenpo 
industry. Thus far, over 500 portraits have been completed. Ed has recently been involved 
on a publication called &quot;The Journey, The oral histories of 25 of the most prominent 
kenpoists today&quot;. Ed did the complete design and layout of the book as well as illustrated 
25 portraits and the cover. This book features some of his tribute to the kenpo industry. 
Ed is also on the international lecture circuit, conducting martial arts workshops and 
seminars. In 1999 Ed traveled around the world, teaching over 100 seminars in 35 of the 
United States and in Ireland, England, Greece, Mexico, Canada, and Venezuela. Ed also published 
a book on his father (Memories of Ed Parker) that has sold over 10,000 copies, to-date. He was 
featured in two consecutive magazine articles in Black Belt Magazine, the largest and most 
widely distributed martial arts periodical in the world. Those profiles appear in the 
November '99 and December '99 issues. He has also been featured in Inside Kung Fu, Karate/Kung-Fu 
Illustrated, Karate and Fitness International, Budo, Fighters, Kampfkunst (Germany), Artes 
Marciales (Mexico), and Full Contact magazines and is scheduled for 3 more magazine articles 
in the European market.<br>
<br>
In the year 2004, he founded and started EPAKS, Inc. a company dedicated towards the publishing 
and producing of high quality teaching and learning materials for the martial arts industry. He has 
just produced over 120 paintings featuring kenpo techniques, each painting has been transformed 
into decks of training cards in which he has produced two decks of 60 cards each. He has also 
just released his first authored book on the &quot;Kenpo Kards&quot; that he produced. Ed has also just 
released the first kenpo designed martial arts uniform. This uniform is ground breaking history 
for the branch of martial arts known as kenpo, one of the largest growing new martial arts. 
This uniform has gotten international recognition and is expected to be used by thousands of 
martial artists around the world.<br>
<br>
Ed is the proud father of four children‹three daughters and one son, and the Grandfather of 
two grandchildren. Ed lives with his wife in Pasadena, California.<br>

		<strong>PROFESSOR RYAN ANGELL</strong><br>
<em>Dean of Education &amp; Int&rsquo;l Director of Outreach Programs</em><br>
<br><br>
Professor Ryan Angell started his American Kenpo training over 20 years ago when he moved to Los Angeles from his native Seattle and found The Martial Science University<span class="tm">TM</span> (MSU). Although having studied Shotokan, Wing Chung and Kali, prior to coming to Los Angeles, he soon fell in love with American Kenpo under his new instructor and student of Ed Parker Sr., Dr. Ron Chapp&eacute;l.
 <br><br>
Mr. Angell has been under the direct instruction of Dr. Chapp&eacute;l ever since, and continues to train in SubLevel Four Kenpo<span class="tm">TM</span> to the present. He is Dr. Chap&eacute;l&rsquo;s highest ranked active student, The Dean of Education and International Director of Outreach Programs at the MSU, entitled to the title &quot;Professor&quot;, and the rank of 7th Degree Black Belt, &quot;Master of the Arts&quot;. Professor Angell has participated in many venues during his career including the original International Karate Championships in Long Beach, California and the European International Karate Championships in Norkoepping, Sweden.
 <br><br>
Fifteen years ago Professor Angell started as an assistant seminar instructor to Dr. Chap&eacute;l. They taught together throughout the United States, Mexico and Europe. This was the launching pad for Angell&rsquo;s own international seminar teaching career that started over five years ago.
 <br><br>
Through Dr. Chapp&eacute;l&rsquo;s 40+ years in law enforcement, Professor Angell has been involved in the training of celebrity security details as well as federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Angell continues to teach and train law enforcement officers at the MSU home school in Los Angeles, which maintains an approximate 80% law enforcement student base. He also holds certification in Advanced Field Tactics for Arrest and Control.
 <br><br>
While maintaining his training and teaching at The MSU, Professor Angell had formal training in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). While at school he studied several elements of TCM such as meridian &amp; point location and Five Element Theory, which enhanced his understanding of the Martial Sciences. Although he has closed his alternative medicine practice of five years he still treats a few private clients with acupressure and herbal &amp; nutritional consultations.<br>

Recently, Mr. King became the Kenpo Division Leader for the Arnold Fitness Expo, which is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. 
 <br><br>
In 2009, Mr. King began regularly teaching in the Central Ohio area, making it the only other place in the United States besides M.S.U. where you can receive SubLevel Four Kenpo<span class="tm">TM</span> training.
